# @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server

## Unreleased Changes

- Added metadata output which includes scanned bytes (for cost tracking) to `execute_dql`
- Added next-steps for `get_entity_details` to find out about metrics, problems and logs
- Added Telemetry via Dynatrace OpenKit to improve the product with anonymous usage statistics and error information (can be disabled via `DT_MCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable)

## 0.5.0

**Highlights**:
🚀 Davis CoPilot AI, supporting natural language to DQL
🌐 HTTP transport support
🔑 Platform Token authentication
📚 Tool consolidation into `execute_dql`

### Scopes

- Removed unnecessary scope `environment-api:security.problems:read` as it's no longer needed
- Removed unneeded scopes `environment-api:slo:read` and `environment-api:metrics:read` as functionality is handled via the `execute_dql` tool

### Tools Added/Removed

- Added tools to translate between natural language and DQL via Davis CoPilot, enabling easier query creation
- Added tool to chat with Davis CoPilot for interactive assistance and guidance
- Removed `get_logs_for_entity` tool in favor of the more flexible `execute_dql` tool
- Removed `get_vulnerability_details` tool as the same functionality can now be achieved with a simple `execute_dql` call, simplifying the tool set
- Removed `get_problem_details` tool as the same functionality can be achieved with a simple `execute_dql` call

### Other Changes

- Added cost considerations disclaimer in README about Dynatrace Grail data access to help users understand potential costs
- Added `dtClientContext` to `execute_dql` tool, enabling usage monitoring for Grail access and better cost tracking
- Added information about Semantic Dictionary for `execute_dql` tool description, improving user guidance for DQL queries
- Added Streamable HTTP transport support with `--http`/`--server`, `--port`, and `--host` arguments, enabling you to run the server over HTTP while maintaining stdio as the default for backward compatibility
- Enhanced `find_entity_by_name` tool to include all entities from the Smartscape topology, providing comprehensive entity discovery capabilities
- Optimized `get_monitored_entity_details` tool to use direct entity type lookup for better performance and faster response times
- Improved `list_vulnerabilities` tool to use DQL statements instead of classic API, aligned parameters with `list_problems` tool for consistent user experience
- Added comprehensive AI-Powered Observability Workshop Rules with hierarchical workflow architecture for advanced analysis scenarios
- Enhanced README with advanced analysis capabilities including incident response, security compliance, and DevOps automation workflows
- Added support for multi-phase incident investigation, cross-data source correlation, and precise root cause identification
- Introduced streamlined rule structure optimized for LLM context windows with all files under 6,500 tokens for better AI assistant performance
- Added integration guides for multiple AI assistants including Amazon Q, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and GitHub Copilot
- Enhanced example prompts with sophisticated use cases for transaction analysis, security assessment, and DevOps workflows
- Removed `metrics` from `execute_dql` example with `fetch` to improve clarity
- Clarified usage of `verify_dql` to avoid unnecessary tool calls and improve efficiency
- Improved `list_problems` tool to use DQL statements for retrieving data from Dynatrace and provide better next steps for problem resolution
- Added support for authorization via Platform Tokens using the `DT_PLATFORM_TOKEN` environment variable, providing an alternative authentication method

## 0.5.0 (Release Candidate 4)

- Added Streamable HTTP transport support with `--http`/`--server`, `--port`, and `--host` arguments (default remains stdio for backward compatibility)
- Adapted `find_entity_by_name` tool to include all entities from the Smartscape topology.
- Optimized `get_monitored_entity_details` tool to use direct entity type lookup for better performance.

## 0.5.0 (Release Candidate 3)

- Improved `list_vulnerabilities` tool to use DQL statement instead of classic API, and aligned parameters with `list_problems` tool
- Removed `get_vulnerability_details` tool as the same can now be achieved with a simple `execute_dql` call
- Removed scope `environment-api:security.problems:read` as it's no longer needed
- Added comprehensive AI-Powered Observability Workshop Rules with hierarchical workflow architecture
- Enhanced README with advanced analysis capabilities including incident response, security compliance, and DevOps automation
- Added support for multi-phase incident investigation, cross-data source correlation, and precise root cause identification
- Introduced streamlined rule structure optimized for LLM context windows (all files under 6,500 tokens)
- Added integration guides for multiple AI assistants (Amazon Q, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, GitHub Copilot)
- Enhanced example prompts with sophisticated use cases for transaction analysis, security assessment, and DevOps workflows
- Removed unneeded scopes `environment-api:slo:read` (no tool is using this) and `environment-api:metrics:read` (anyway handled via execute DQL tool)
- Removed `metrics` from `execute_dql` example with `fetch`.
- Clarified usage of `verify_dql` to avoid unnecessary tool calls.

## 0.5.0 (Release Candidate 2)

- Improved `list_problems` tool to use a DQL statement to retrieve data from Dynatrace, and provide better next steps
